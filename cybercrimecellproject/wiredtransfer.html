					Business Email Compromise
				</h1>
				<p>
					This kind of fraud depends on use of a real email address that is deceptively similar to one that would be used by the target company or its legitimate suppliers to trigger a kind of “fictitious payee” scam. The target company is tricked into sending funds by wire transfer to a bank account which is under the fraudsters’ control. This bank account is often in Hong Kong, UK, China and the timeframe for intercepting and recovering funds that have been stolen in this way is very short. 
				</p>
				<h1 style="font-size: 35px; color: #2c3e50;">
					Preventive Measures/Precautions
				</h1>
				<p>
					1. Avoid free web-based e-mail accounts: Establish a company domain name and use it to establish company e-mail accounts in lieu of free, web-based accounts.<br/>


					2. Be careful what is posted to social media and company websites, especially job duties/descriptions, hierarchal information, and out of office details.<br/>


					3. Be suspicious of requests for secrecy or pressure to take action quickly.<br/>


					4. Consider additional IT and financial security procedures, including the implementation of a 2-step verification process. For example -


					o Out of Band Communication: Establish other communication channels, such as telephone calls, to verify significant transactions. Arrange this second-factor authentication early in the relationship and outside the e-mail environment to avoid interception by a hacker.


					o Digital Signatures: Both entities on each side of a transaction should utilize digital signatures. This will not work with web-based e-mail accounts. Additionally, some countries ban or limit the use of encryption.


					o Delete Spam: Immediately report and delete unsolicited e-mail (spam) from unknown parties. DO NOT open spam e-mail, click on links in the e-mail, or open attachments. These often contain malware that will give subjects access to your computer system.


					o Forward vs. Reply: Do not use the “Reply” option to respond to any business e-mails. Instead, use the “Forward” option and either type in the correct e-mail address or select it from the e-mail address book to ensure the intended recipient’s correct e-mail address is used.

					<br/>
					5. Consider implementing Two Factor Authentication (TFA) for corporate e-mail accounts. TFA mitigates the threat of a subject gaining access to an employee’s e-mail account through a compromised password by requiring two pieces of information to login: something you know (a password) and something you have (such as a dynamic PIN or code).<br/>


					6. Significant Changes: Beware of sudden changes in business practices. For example, if a current business contact suddenly asks to be contacted via their personal e-mail address when all previous official correspondence has been through company e-mail, the request could be fraudulent. Always verify via other channels that you are still communicating with your legitimate business partner.<br/>


					7. Create intrusion detection system rules that flag e-mails with extensions that are similar to company e-mail. For example, legitimate e-mail of abc_company.com would flag fraudulent e-mail of abc-company.com.<br/>


					8. Register all company domains that are slightly different than the actual company domain.<br/>


					9. Verify changes in vendor payment location by adding additional two-factor authentication such as having a secondary sign-off by company personnel.<br/>


					10. Confirm requests for transfers of funds. When using phone verification as part of the two-factor authentication, use previously known numbers, not the numbers provided in the e-mail request.<br/>


					11. Know the habits of your customers, including the details of, reasons behind, and amount of payments.<br/>


					12. Carefully scrutinize all e-mail requests for transfers of funds to determine if the requests are out of the ordinary.<br/>
