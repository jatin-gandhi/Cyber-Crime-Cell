					Lottery Scams
				</h1>
				<p>
						In this type of scam where the sender requests to help in facilitating the transfer of a substantial sum of money, generally in the form of an email. In return, the sender offers a commission, usually in the range of several million dollars. The scammers then request that money be sent to pay for some of the costs associated with the transfer. If money is sent to the scammers, they will either disappear immediately or try to get more money with claims of continued problems with the transfer.
<br />
						In such matters the victims normally allege that they have received emails from unknown sources wherein they have been informed that:
<br />
						• Either they have won a lottery worth millions of dollars; or
<br />
						• Their help is required for transferring of illegal money from some foreign Country; or
<br />
						• Goods are offered at throwaway prices; or
<br />
						• In some cases, the victim's address book in her emailing list is compromised and emails sent to all contacts from ID asking for money to bail her out from a perilous situation;
<br />
						The victims are trapped in a phased manner and are generally made to deposit a huge amount of money either as money transfer fee, payment of taxes or transportation cost.
<br />
						The victims apparently receives a spam email and respond to the same and end up paying money to some unknown persons for a nonexistent purpose.
<br />
						Such crimes are generally carried out from foreign locations. Money is either deposited in offshore accounts or in some carrier account in India.
